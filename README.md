# xAI-Inspired Multi-Agent AI for Exoplanet Discovery
A multi-agent system using NASA TESS data to detect, validate, and assess exoplanets for habitability.

## Features
- Agent 1: CNN detection with 100% accuracy on prototype (TensorFlow).
- Agent 2: Orbit validation with SymPy and data-driven period/depth.
- Agent 3: Reporting with plots.
- Agent 4: Habitability assessment.
- Streamlit demo with file upload for interactive analysis.

## Run the Demo
1. Install: `pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scipy sympy lightkurve streamlit`.
2. Run `streamlit run app.py`.

Aligned with xAI's mission to accelerate scientific discovery and SpaceX's multi-planetary vision.
